## 📌 Project Overview

This project utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with PyTorch** to estimate the screen time of characters in the classic *Tom and Jerry* animated series. By analyzing video frames, the model predicts when *Tom*, *Jerry*, or neither appears in a scene.

### 🔹 Key Features:
- **AI-powered screen time estimation** for animated characters.
- **Deep learning-based image classification** using CNNs.
- **Dataset from Kaggle or Google Drive** (link below).
- **Training, evaluation, and visualization** for insights.

## 🎥 How It Works

1️⃣ **Frame Extraction** - Extracts frames from *Tom and Jerry* episodes.  
2️⃣ **Preprocessing** - Resizes, normalizes, and augments images.  
3️⃣ **CNN Model Training** - Uses a deep learning model for classification.  
4️⃣ **Inference & Visualization** - Predicts character presence and displays results.

## 🗂️ Dataset

You can download the dataset from one of the following sources:

📌 **Kaggle Dataset:**  
🔗 [Tom and Jerry Image Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balabaskar/tom-and-jerry-image-classification)  

📌 **Google Drive Dataset:**  
🔗 [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/180efdVz6qR4IiWMzFW4Xd8YCwEJOtMER?usp=sharing)  

Once downloaded, organize the dataset as follows:

dataset/ │── train/ │ ├── tom/ │ ├── jerry/ │ ├── background/ # No character present │── val/ │ ├── tom/ │ ├── jerry/ │ ├── background/ │── test/ │ ├── tom/ │ ├── jerry/ │ ├── background/
